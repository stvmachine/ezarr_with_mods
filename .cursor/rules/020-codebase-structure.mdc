# Codebase Structure

## Project Overview

This is a Docker Compose-based media server stack (Servarr suite) with Python helper scripts.

## File Organization

- Python scripts belong in the `scripts/` directory
- Configuration files (docker-compose.yml) stay in root
- Keep documentation (README.md) up to date with service changes
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project

## Directory Structure

```
ezarr/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/          # Cursor rule files
├── scripts/             # Python helper scripts
├── docker-compose.yml   # Docker Compose configuration
├── setup.sh            # Setup script
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── .env                # Environment variables (not committed)
```
